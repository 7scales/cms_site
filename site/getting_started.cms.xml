	<h2>It's Chat App Time</h2>
	<p><strong>Author</strong>: Mads Hartmann Jensen <br/>
	  <strong>Code co-author</strong>: David Pollak</p>

	<p>I have the honor to represent the demo that David Pollak gives all
	  the time, it's the ubiquitous Lift chat app.</p>
	<p>In this article I'll show how you can create a comet-enabled chat
	  application using Lift. I will show all the code you need to get it
	  working and walk through the lines step by step to give you an
	  understanding of what's happening. In the end I'll show how to enhance
	  the application with some extra functionality and a few effects.</p>
	<p>Before we begin I want to say a quick word about comet in case it's
	  the first you've heard of it. Comet describes a model where the client
	  sends a request to the server. The request is hanging till the server
	  has something interesting to response. As soon as the server responses
	  another request is made. The idea is to give the impression that the
	  server is notifying the client of changes on the server.</p>
	<p>To get started install the <a
					 href="http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/">Simple Build Tool</a>
	  (aka sbt) and download the <a
					href="http://github.com/lift/lift_sbt_prototype/tarball/Lift_20">TAR</a>
	  or <a href="http://github.com/lift/lift_sbt_prototype/zipball/Lift_20">Zip</a>
	  of the default Lift project and un-tar or un-zip the file.</p>

	<p>Now <em>cd</em> into the new folder and type <code>sbt update</code>
	  to grab the dependencies.</p>
	<p>Next, spark up your editor of choice and create the <em>src/main/scala/code/comet/Chat.scala</em>
	  file. Put the following code into Chat.scala (before you get all
	  cranky-like that we're mixing mark-up and logic, the step after this
	  one will show how to separate the two):</p>
	<pre class="brush: scala;">package code.comet

import net.liftweb._
import http._
import actor._

object ChatServer extends LiftActor with ListenerManager {
  private var messages = List("Welcome")

  def createUpdate = messages

  override def lowPriority = {
    case s: String =&gt; messages ::= s ; updateListeners()
 }
}

class Chat extends CometActor with CometListener { 

  private var msgs: List[String] = Nil 

  def registerWith = ChatServer 

  override def lowPriority = {
    case m: List[String] =&gt; msgs = m; reRender(false) 
  } 

  def render = { 
    &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
    {
      msgs.reverse.map(m =&gt; &lt;li&gt;{m}&lt;/li&gt;)
    }
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;lift:form&gt;
    {
      SHtml.text("", s =&gt; ChatServer ! s)
    }
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Chat"/&gt;
    &lt;/lift:form&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  }
}</pre>

	<p>Add the tag: <code>&lt;lift:comet
	    type="Chat"/&gt;</code> to the existing <em>src/main/webapp/index.html</em> file and run the app by typing the following in your
	  console:</p>
	<pre><code>sbt ~jetty-run</code></pre>
	Now browse to <em>http://localhost:8080</em> with multiple browsers
	and you have your chat app. Pretty cool huh? Lets walk through the code
	to figure out how it all fits together.
	<pre class="brush: scala;">object ChatServer extends LiftActor with ListenerManager {

  private var messages = List("Welcome")
  
  def createUpdate = messages
  
  override def lowPriority = {
    case s: String =&gt; messages ::= s ; updateListeners()
  }
}</pre>

	<p>We're doing a couple of things here. In the first line we're
	  defining a chat server as an object (singleton) that's a <a
								      href="http://main.scala-tools.org/mvnsites/liftweb-2.0/framework/scaladocs/net/liftweb/actor/LiftActor.html"
								      target="_blank">LiftActor</a> and that can manage listeners by mixing
	  in the <a
		    href="http://main.scala-tools.org/mvnsites/liftweb-2.0/framework/scaladocs/net/liftweb/http/ListenerManager.html"
		    target="_blank">ListenerManager</a> trait.</p>
	<p>In the implementation of our ChatServer we're creating a private
	  list of strings that we'll use to store the messages posted by the
	  clients. The createUpdate method is called when the updateListeners
	  method needs a message to send to the subscribed Actors. Here's it's
	  simply returning all the messages posted to the server.</p>
	<p>Lastly we're overriding the lowPriority method where we're pattern
	  matching against the messages sent to us. If the message is a string
	  we're simply adding it to the list of messages and telling all the
	  listeners that something happened by invoking the updateListeners
	  method which we got by mixing in the ListenerManager trait.</p>
	<p>lowPriority is just one of three methods (lowPriority,
	  mediumPriority, hightPriority) you can override to process the
	  messages. As the names may suggest the three methods let you
	  prioritize your messages.</p>
	<pre class="brush: scala;">class Chat extends CometActor with CometListener {</pre>
	<p>Here we're defining our chat component that knows how to push
	  updates to the browser and interact with the ChatServer.</p>

	<pre class="brush: scala;">private var msgs: List[String] = Nil</pre>
	<p>This is where we'll store our local state.</p>
	<pre class="brush: scala;">def registerWith = ChatServer</pre>
	<p>Here the component is registrering itself with the ChatSever so it
	  will get notified of any changes. </p>
	<pre class="brush: scala;">override def lowPriority = {
  case m: List[String] =&gt; msgs = m; reRender(false)
}</pre>
	<p>This is where we implement how our component will handle the
	  messages from our ChatServer. We're simply updating our local state
	  (msgs) and invoking reRender(false). false tells Lift that we don't
	  want to rerender the entire page but just the comet component.</p>

	<pre class="brush: scala;">def render = {
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  {
    msgs.reverse.map(m =&gt; &lt;li&gt;{m}&lt;/li&gt;)
  }
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;lift:form&gt;
  {
    // a &lt;lift:form&gt; is an Ajax form. Define our
    // input box that sends the message to the chat server
    SHtml.text("", s =&gt; ChatServer ! s)
  }
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Chat"/&gt;
  &lt;/lift:form&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
}</pre>

	<p>Here we're telling the component how to render itself. But, <strong>OMG</strong>...
	  we've mixed view logic with our Scala code, gaaakkk... sputter... barf.
	  Yes, Lift allows you to mix view into your business logic, but it's a
	  choice. Here's how we can break the code out to separate the view from
	  the logic. The critical thing to keep in mind is that we did not change
	  our logic at all in order to achieve the separation.</p>
	<p>First, let's update our view (<em>src/main/webapp/index.html</em>)
	  to:</p>
	<pre class="brush: xhtml;">&lt;lift:comet type="Chat"&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;chat:line&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;chat:msg/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/chat:line&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;lift:form&gt;
    &lt;chat:input/&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="chat"/&gt;
  &lt;/lift:form&gt;
&lt;/lift:comet&gt;</pre>

	<p>The view now contains the definition of the layout with "bind
	  points" where dynamic content will be inserted.</p>
	<p>Next, let's update our Chat component's render method. Replace the
	  def render = line through the end of the file (except the closing
	  brace) with:</p>
	<pre class="brush: scala;">// import NodeSeq... yes, this can be done inside any scope in Scala
import scala.xml.NodeSeq

def render =
  bind("chat", // the namespace for binding
  "line" -&gt; lines _, // bind the function lines
  "input" -&gt; SHtml.text("", s =&gt; ChatServer ! s))

private def lines(xml: NodeSeq): NodeSeq =
  msgs.reverse.flatMap(m =&gt; bind("chat", xml, "msg" -&gt; m))</pre>

	<p>Instead of using inline xhtml we're using the bind method. You'll
	  find the bind method in the <a
					 href="http://main.scala-tools.org/mvnsites/liftweb-2.0/framework/scaladocs/net/liftweb/util/BindHelpers$object.html"
					 target="_blank">BindHelpers</a> trait and it is used to bind real
	  content to the binding points of your templates.</p>
	<p>In this code we're binding content to tags with the namespace <em>chat</em>.
	  The last argument of bind is repeatable and accepts <a
								 href="http://main.scala-tools.org/mvnsites/liftweb-2.0/framework/scaladocs/net/liftweb/util/BindHelpers.BindParam.html"
								 target="_blank">BindParam</a>. So the second and third line of the
	  bind statement are really instances of BindParam and should be read:
	  "replace the tag <code>&lt;chat:line&gt;</code> with the return value
	  of invoking lines" and "replace the tag <code>&lt;chat:input&gt;</code>
	  with the return value of invoking the text method on the SHtml object".
	  <br />

	  You might notice that we aren't specifying which xml to bind to in our
	  bind statements like we've done previously. This is because the markup
	  passed to the comet component when it is instantiated (i.e. every child
	  node of <code>&lt;lift:comet type="Chat"&gt;</code>) is kept around
	  and that's what we're binding against.</p>
	<p>The method <span style="font-family: monospace;">lines</span>
	  simply takes a NodeSeq and returns a NodeSeq. It reverses the list of
	  messages so the newest message will be at the end of the list and
	  flatMaps the list of messages into the proper xhtml by using the bind
	  method. Note that we have to use flatMap instead of map, because map
	  would result in a Seq[NodeSeq] instead of the expeced NodeSeq
	  (Seq[Node]).</p>
	<p>The text method of the <a
				     href="http://main.scala-tools.org/mvnsites/liftweb-2.0/framework/scaladocs/net/liftweb/http/SHtml$object.html"
				     target="_blank">SHtml</a> object returns an input field. The method
	  takes two normal arguments and a repeatable one. The first is the
	  initial value of the input field and the second is a function that
	  takes a string and returns Any (<em>(String) =&gt; Any</em>). This
	  function will be invoked when the form is submitted. Our function takes
	  a string s and sends that string to our ChatServer using the bang (!)
	  method.</p>

	<p>I hope this has helped you gain a better understanding of what the
	  code does. Now, it would be quite dull if all I did was recite the demo
	  that David has done numerous times - Lets see if I can't spice the demo
	  application up a bit to provide some extra functionality.</p>
	<p>Lets add the following to our application</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>It should be possible to delete messages</li>
	  <li>When a message is deleted/added it should fade out/in</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To achieve this lets start editing the view (<em>src/main/webapp/index.html</em>)
	  so it looks like this:</p>
	<pre class="brush: xhtml;">&lt;lift:comet type="Chat"&gt;
  &lt;ul id="ul_dude"&gt;
    &lt;chat:line&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;chat:msg/&gt; &lt;chat:btn/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/chat:line&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;lift:form&gt;
    &lt;chat:input/&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="chat"/&gt;
  &lt;/lift:form&gt;
&lt;/lift:comet&gt;</pre>

	<p>Not a whole lot change in the view, we simply added a new tag <code>&lt;chat:btn/&gt;</code>
	  and added an id attribute to the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag. So lets
	  fast forward to the exciting part. Changing the <em>ChatServer</em>
	  and <em>Chat</em>.</p>
	<p>Start by adding the following imports to your <em>src/main/scala/code/comet/Chat.scala</em>
	  file:</p>

	<pre class="brush: scala;">import js._
import JsCmds._
import js.jquery.JqJsCmds.{AppendHtml, FadeOut, Hide, FadeIn}
import java.util.Date
import scala.xml._
import util.Helpers
import util.Helpers._</pre>
	<p>Now that we've got the right classes imported lets start looking at
	  the actual code, again in your <em>src/main/scala/code/comet/Chat.scala</em>
	  file add the following:</p>
	<pre class="brush: scala;">sealed trait ChatCmd

object ChatCmd {
  implicit def strToMsg(msg: String): ChatCmd =
  new AddMessage(Helpers.nextFuncName, msg, new Date)
}

final case class AddMessage(guid: String, msg: String, date: Date) extends ChatCmd
final case class RemoveMessage(guid: String) extends ChatCmd</pre>

	<p>In the two last lines we're creating two case classes (the final
	  keyword means you can't subclass them). We're going to send instances
	  of these classes between the client and server instead of strings as we
	  did earlier. We're also creating an object named ChatCmd which has an
	  implicit conversion from string to AddMessage as this will simplify the
	  code in Chat as we'll be able to send the string the user entered in
	  the input field and let the implicit conversion do the work of
	  instantiating an instance of AddMessage.</p>
	<p>The <code>Helpers.nextFuncName</code> simply creates a unique
	  string based on the current time and a random String generation. We use
	  it here as a unique id for both AddMessage and RemoveMessage.</p>
	<p>Now lets take a look how we need to change the ChatServer:</p>
	<pre class="brush: scala;">object ChatServer extends LiftActor with ListenerManager {

  private var messages: List[ChatCmd] = List("Welcome")
  
  def createUpdate = messages
  
  override def lowPriority = {
    case s: String =&gt; messages ::= s ; updateListeners()
    case d: RemoveMessage =&gt; messages ::= d ; updateListeners()
  }
}</pre>

	<p>Instead of using a list of strings to store our messages we're using
	  a list of ChatCmd (both AddMessage and RemoveMessage are subclasses of
	  ChatCmd). The lowPriority message has also changed a bit. We're pattern
	  matching against the message and if it's a string we simply add it to
	  the list of ChatCmd ... but wait ... String isn't a subclass of ChatCmd
	  so surely this doesn't compile. Oh, but it does, this is where our
	  implicit conversion from String to AddMessage comes in handy. The
	  compiler does notice that String isn't a subclass of ChatCmd but before
	  it starts complaining it checks if there is any implicit conversion in
	  scope that might be able to solve the type problem and in this case
	  there is.</p>
	<p>Finally lets take a look at the Chat. Replace the following
	  implementation of Chat with the one currently in your file:</p>
	<pre class="brush: scala;">class Chat extends CometActor with CometListener { 
  private var msgs: List[ChatCmd] = Nil 
  private var bindLine: NodeSeq = Nil
  
  def registerWith = ChatServer 
  
  override def lowPriority = {
    case m: List[ChatCmd] =&gt; {
      val delta = m diff msgs
      msgs = m
      updateDeltas(delta)
    }
  } 
  
  def updateDeltas(what: List[ChatCmd]) {
    partialUpdate(what.foldRight(Noop) {
      case (m: AddMessage , x) =&gt;
        x &amp; AppendHtml("ul_dude", doLine(m)) &amp;
        Hide(m.guid) &amp; FadeIn(m.guid, TimeSpan(0),TimeSpan(500))
      case (RemoveMessage(guid), x) =&gt;
        x &amp; FadeOut(guid,TimeSpan(0),TimeSpan(500)) &amp;
        After(TimeSpan(500),Replace(guid, NodeSeq.Empty))
    })
  }
  
  def render =
    bind("chat", // the namespace for binding
      "line" -&gt; lines _, // bind the function lines
      "input" -&gt; SHtml.text("", s =&gt; ChatServer ! s)) // the input
  
  private def lines(xml: NodeSeq): NodeSeq = {
    bindLine = xml
    val deleted = Set((for {
      RemoveMessage(guid) &lt;- msgs
    } yield guid) :_*)
  
    for {
      m @ AddMessage(guid, msg, date) &lt;- msgs.reverse if !deleted.contains(guid)
      node &lt;- doLine(m) 
    } yield node
  }
  
  private def doLine(m: AddMessage): NodeSeq =
    bind("chat", addId(bindLine, m.guid),
      "msg" -&gt; m.msg,
      "btn" -&gt; SHtml.ajaxButton("delete", 
        () =&gt; {
          ChatServer ! 
          RemoveMessage(m.guid)
          Noop}))
  
  
  private def addId(in: NodeSeq, id: String): NodeSeq = in map {
    case e: Elem =&gt; e % ("id" -&gt; id)
    case x =&gt; x
  }
}</pre>

	<p>Bam, If you restart the jetty server and browse to
	  http://localhost:8080 after pasting in the above code you should have a
	  chat application with fancy fading messages and the ability to delete
	  old messages. I hope this is enough to keep your motivated as we walk
	  through the code. Lets take it from the top:</p>
	<pre class="brush: scala;">class Chat extends CometActor with CometListener { 
  private var msgs: List[ChatCmd] = Nil 
  private var bindLine: NodeSeq = Nil
  
  def registerWith = ChatServer</pre>
	<p>We're declaring a list of ChatCmd which we'll use as our local state
	  (ChatCmd instead of String) and a NodeSeq called bindLine which I'll
	  talk about later when we're using it. We're still registering with
	  ChatServer.</p>
	<pre class="brush: scala;">override def lowPriority = {
 case m: List[ChatCmd] =&gt; {
   val delta = m diff msgs
   msgs = m
   updateDeltas(delta)
 }
}</pre>

	<p>Again, the lowPriority method is the one that deals with the
	  messages sent from the ChatServer. We're pattern matching against the
	  messages and if it's a list of ChatCmd we're calculating the difference
	  between the new list and our local state using the diff method on List
	  and store the result in the variable delta. Then we're replacing our
	  local state with the new list and finally we call updateDeltas with
	  delta. Now lets take a look at what updateDeltas actually does:</p>
	<pre class="brush: scala;">def updateDeltas(what: List[ChatCmd]) {
  partialUpdate(what.foldRight(Noop) {
    case (m: AddMessage , x) =&gt;
      x &amp; AppendHtml("ul_dude", doLine(m)) &amp;
      Hide(m.guid) &amp; FadeIn(m.guid, TimeSpan(0),TimeSpan(500))
    case (RemoveMessage(guid), x) =&gt;
      x &amp; FadeOut(guid,TimeSpan(0),TimeSpan(500)) &amp;
      After(TimeSpan(500),Replace(guid, NodeSeq.Empty))
  })
}</pre>

	<p>We're calling partialUpdate which is declared in CometActor and
	  takes a <a
		     href="http://main.scala-tools.org/mvnsites/liftweb-2.0/framework/scaladocs/net/liftweb/http/js/JsCmd.html"
		     target="_blank">JsCmd</a> as it's only argument. As the name may
	  suggest partialUpdate is used to do partial updates of your comet
	  component. The exciting part of updateDeltas is how we convert a
	  List[ChatCmd] into a JsCmd. Lets take a look.</p>
	<p>We declared <em>what</em> as an argument of updateDeltas. We're
	  calling foldRight on <em>what</em> which is a method on List that has
	  the following method signature <code>foldRight [B](z : B)(f : (A, B)
	    =&gt; B) : B</code>. Unless you're used to reading Scala code this
	  doesn't help you much, so here's the explanation of foldRight from the
	  Scala Library Documentation: <q>Combines the elements of this list
	    together using the binary function f, from right to left, and starting
	    with the value z</q>.</p>

	<p>In our case we're currying it with Noop which extends JsCmd and
	  basically is an empty javascript statement. In the binary function
	  we're pattern matching against the arguments which is the current
	  element from the list starting from the right-most element and the
	  cumulated value of foldRight so far.</p>
	<p>If the element is an instance of AddMessage we're doing a couple of
	  things, first off we're chaining javascripts calls using the &amp;
	  method (okay, you can call it an operator, but it's a method with a
	  symbolic name). The left-most argument well be invoked before the
	  right-most one. We're also using the AppendHtml object declared in <a
										href="http://main.scala-tools.org/mvnsites/liftweb-2.0/framework/scaladocs/net/liftweb/http/js/jquery/JqJsCmds$object.html"
										target="_blank">JqJsCmds</a> which has an apply method <code>def
	    apply(uid: String, content: NodeSeq): JsCmd</code> that takes the id of
	  the node to append html to, in this case it's our UL tag with the id <em>ul_dude</em>.
	  The second argument is the NodeSeq to append. In this case we're
	  calling the doLine method with our instance of AddMessage. Well go
	  through that method in due time don't worry. For the second argument of
	  the first CmdPair we're chaining together another CmdPair where we're
	  hiding the html we've just created using the <a
							  href="http://main.scala-tools.org/mvnsites/liftweb-2.0/framework/scaladocs/net/liftweb/http/js/jquery/JqJsCmds/Hide.html"
							  target="_blank">Hide</a> class and then we're using the <a
														     href="http://main.scala-tools.org/mvnsites/liftweb-2.0/framework/scaladocs/net/liftweb/http/js/jquery/JqJsCmds/FadeIn.html"
														     target="_blank">FadeIn</a> object to fade in the message. Had this not
	  been a demo I would probably have added a css class to the newly
	  created messages with the display property set to none and then simply
	  fade in the messages ones added.</p>

	<p>In the second match statement we're using Scala Extractors to fetch
	  the value guid of RemoveMessage. For more information about extractors
	  read <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/112" target="_blank">this</a>.
	  If the unapply method on RemoveMessage was successful (i.e. returned
	  Some) we're using CmdPair once more. First we're fading out the message
	  using <a
		   href="http://main.scala-tools.org/mvnsites/liftweb-2.0/framework/scaladocs/net/liftweb/http/js/jquery/JqJsCmds/FadeOut.html"
		   target="_blank">FadeOut</a> and then we're creating an instance of <a
											 href="http://main.scala-tools.org/mvnsites/liftweb-2.0/framework/scaladocs/net/liftweb/http/js/JsCmds/After.html"
											 target="_blank">After</a> which allows us to invoke a JsCmd after
	  waiting for the amount of time specified in the instantiation of After.
	  The JsCmd we're handing to After is an instance of <a
								href="http://main.scala-tools.org/mvnsites/liftweb-2.0/framework/scaladocs/net/liftweb/http/js/JsCmds/Replace.html"
								target="_blank">Replace</a> which we use to replace the node with id
	  guid with NodeSeq.Empty (i.e. nothing).</p>
	<p>In each case we're using the &amp; method to combine the new JsCmd
	  with the cumulated JsCmd which means that the entire foldRight method
	  wil results in a JsCmd that will remove all unwanted messages and add
	  all the new ones on the fly with Javascript. Neat!</p>

	<p>The render method hasn't changed so we can skip that. The lines
	  method however has, so lets take a look at it:</p>
	<pre class="brush: scala;">private def lines(xml: NodeSeq): NodeSeq = {
  bindLine = xml
  val deleted = Set((for {
    RemoveMessage(guid) &lt;- msgs
  } yield guid) :_*)

  for {
    m @ AddMessage(guid, msg, date) &lt;- msgs.reverse if !deleted.contains(guid)
    node &lt;- doLine(m) 
  } yield node

	<p>The first thing we're doing is storing the xml in the private
	  variable bindLine (the one I mentioned earlier). We're storing it
	  because we need to use it in the doLine method that I'll explain next.
	  Next we're creating a local variable <em>deleted</em> that we'll use
	  to store the guid of all the messages that should be deleted. We find
	  all the deleted messages by using a for comprehension. We're yielding
	  the guid of all the objects in msgs (our local list of messages) by
	  using the RemoveMessage extractor (which I explained earlier) in our
	  for-comprehension. The for-comprehension returns a List so if we pass
	  it to Set(..) we'll get a Set with Lists instead of a Set of String. To
	  avoid this we're using :_* which tells scala to pass each element of
	  the list to Set as a separate argument.</p>
	<p>Next we're using yet another for-comprehension. This time we want to
	  do something with all the instances in msgs (reversed) that isn't part
	  of set of deleted messages. In the second line we're storing the result
	  of invoking doLine with the message. Again we're yielding the result of
	  the for-comprehension so the result of the for-comprehension will be
	  NodeSeq.</p>
	<p>Finally it's time to take a look at doLine:</p>
	<pre class="brush: scala;">private def doLine(m: AddMessage): NodeSeq =
  bind("chat", addId(bindLine, m.guid),
    "msg" -&gt; m.msg,
    "btn" -&gt; SHtml.ajaxButton("delete", 
      () =&gt; {
        ChatServer ! 
        RemoveMessage(m.guid)
        Noop}))</pre>

	<p>We're using the bind message to bind content to nodes with the
	  prefix chat in the NodeSeq returned by calling addId with bindLine and
	  the guid of the AddMessage passed to doLine. We'll look at addId next.
	  The new thing in this bind statement is the invocation of
	  SHtml.ajaxButton(...). The AjaxButton of the <a
							  href="http://main.scala-tools.org/mvnsites/liftweb-2.0/framework/scaladocs/net/liftweb/http/SHtml$object.html"
							  target="_blank">SHtml object</a> takes two arguments, the text of the
	  button and a function that takes zero arguments and returns a JsCmd
	  that will get invoked when the button is clicked. In this case we're
	  setting the value of the button to delete and the function sends a
	  RemoveMessage with the guid of the current message to the ChatServer
	  followed by Noop.</p>
	<p>Now lets take a look at the very last method:</p>
	<pre class="brush: scala;">private def addId(in: NodeSeq, id: String): NodeSeq = in map {
  case e: Elem =&gt; e % ("id" -&gt; id)
  case x =&gt; x
}</pre>

	<p>It takes a NodeSeq and a String. It simply matches against the
	  NodeSeq: If it's an Elem (scala.xml.Elem) it simply adds the attribute
	  id with the value of the argument id. If it's anything else (well it
	  has to be NodeSeq or a subclass of NodeSeq or else the compiler would
	  have complained) it just returns that.</p>
	<p>And thats it! I hope this have given you some taste of what Lift is
	  able to do. If you have any feedback please don't hesitate to
	  communicate it to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/liftweb"
				   target="_blank">community</a>.</p>
