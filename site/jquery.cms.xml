        <h1>Including jQuery in your project</h1>
        <p>Up until Lift 2.4, we included two versions of jQuery, 1.3 and 1.4. But both are very old versions by now. After some discussions on the
          mailing list we decided that the best solution moving forward was to require users include their own version of jQuery.</p>
        <h2>Options:</h2>
        <h3>Host your own</h3>
        <p>You can download jQuery and include it on your projects webapp/js folder (you may have to create the js folder).
          Then you reference this jQuery file in your template by using:
          <pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery-1.7.2.min.js" id="jquery"&gt;
            &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
        </p>
        <h3>Use a CDN</h3>
        <p>Instead of downloading jQuery to your project, you just reference jQuery in your tempalte like this:
          <pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js" id="jquery"&gt;
            &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
        </p>
        <h3>Use the lift-jquery-module module</h3>
        <p>This is a module written by one of the Lift committers, Peter Petersson. The idea behind this module is that it will provide a min version of the jQuery
          file in production mode, while providing the regular version during development.<br></br>
          This is a separate module to allow rapid release cycles to keep up with jQuery upstream.
        </p>
        <p>Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/karma4u101/lift-jquery-module">README.md</a> file for instructions on using this module</p>
        <p>If you are having problems getting started, head over to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/liftweb">mailing list.</a></p>
