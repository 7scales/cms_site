      Lift is the kind of web framework that enables you as a developer to concentrate on the big picture. Strong, expressive typing and higher-level features like the built-in Comet support allow you to focus on innovating instead of the 
      plumbing. Building a rich, real-time web application like Novell Pulse requires a framework with the power of Lift 
      under the covers.
