      <h2>Comet made easy!</h2>
      <p>
       &ldquo;Lift's excellent 'Comet made easy' philosophy made it an absolute no-brainer 
       as the choice of framework for the Apache ESME project. Additionally, the fact 
       that Lift-based applications run unchanged on the SAP's NetWeaver CE Java 
       application server makes this an intriguing approach for enterprise applications 
       in the SAP world.&ldquo;
