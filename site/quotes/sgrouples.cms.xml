				<h2>Security-driven design, with stellar Ajax and Comet support!</h2>
				<p class="lead">
					Sgrouples is a social platform with a new approach to privacy and security
					on the web. Our team pushed Sgrouples from conceptual ideas to a
					publicly available release in just nine months. Some reasons we
					chose the Lift framework are its security-driven design and its
					stellar Ajax and Comet support. Lift paves the way for a secure,
					responsive real time application that is fun to use and even
					greater fun to develop.
