Sgrouples is a social platform with a new approach to privacy and security on the web. Our team pushed Sgrouples from conceptual ideas to a publicly available release in just nine months. Some reasons we chose the Lift framework are its security-driven design and its stellar Ajax and Comet support. Lift paves the way for a secure, responsive real time application that is fun to use and even greater fun to develop.
